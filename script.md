**"What if I told you that generating a video from text in Java is not just possible, but could cost you six dollars and take four minutes every single time you press run?"**

[Cut to screen recording showing a simple API call]

**"Google's new Veo 3 API can create stunning 8-second videos from just a text prompt. But here's the catch—it's not a simple request-response. The API immediately returns an operation ID, then you have to poll for completion. And if you do it wrong, you'll burn through your CPU and your budget."**

**"Today I'm going to show you five different Java approaches to solve this polling problem, from the naive Python-style approach that will destroy your server, to elegant reactive solutions using Spring WebFlux, virtual threads, and more. By the end, you'll know exactly which approach to use for your specific use case."**

## Problem Introduction (0:20–2:00)

[SCREEN: Switch to presentation slide showing API flow diagram]

**"Let's start with understanding what we're working with. Google's Veo 3 is a text-to-video generation model that creates 720p videos at 24 fps. Each 8-second video costs about 6 dollars—yes, you heard that right—so we want to get this implementation correct the first time."**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Veo API
    participant File Service
    
    Client->>Veo API: POST /predictLongRunning
    Veo API-->>Client: {"name": "operations/abc123"}
    
    loop Every 5 seconds
        Client->>Veo API: GET /operations/abc123
        Veo API-->>Client: {"done": false}
    end
    
    Client->>Veo API: GET /operations/abc123
    Veo API-->>Client: {"done": true, "response": {"uri": "..."}}}
    
    Client->>File Service: GET video_uri
    File Service-->>Client: 302 Redirect
    Client->>File Service: Follow redirect
    File Service-->>Client: Video bytes
```

**"The process is straightforward but has some gotchas. First, you submit your prompt and get an operation ID immediately. Then you need to poll that operation until it's complete—which typically takes 2 to 4 minutes. Finally, you download the video file, but here's a critical detail most tutorials miss—the download URL returns a 302 redirect that you must handle properly."**

```json
{
  "name": "models/veo-3.0-generate-preview/operations/abc123",
  "done": true,
  "response": {
    "generateVideoResponse": {
      "generatedSamples": [{

        }
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

**"Now, the naive approach - and this is what most Python tutorials show - is a simple while loop with a sleep. Let me show you why this is problematic in Java."**

---

## The Naive Approach (2:00–3:30)

[SCREEN: VS Code showing bad polling code]

**"Here's what a direct translation from Python would look like:"**

```java
// DON'T DO THIS - Blocks threads and wastes resources
public VideoResult generateVideoNaive(String prompt) {
    VideoGenerationResponse response = submitRequest(prompt);
    String operationId = response.operationId();
    
    OperationStatus status;
    do {
        Thread.sleep(5000); // Blocks the thread!
        status = checkStatus(operationId);
    } while (!status.done());
    
    return downloadVideo(operationId);
}
```

**"This might work in Python where you typically run one request at a time, but in a Java web application, this is a disaster. You're blocking precious threads from your thread pool. If you have a default Tomcat configuration with 200 threads, and 50 users try to generate videos simultaneously, you've just consumed 25% of your thread pool for 4 minutes each. Your application will become unresponsive."**

[SCREEN: Show thread pool monitoring with threads stuck]

**"Plus, this approach doesn't handle timeouts, cancellation, or error recovery gracefully. We need better solutions. Let me show you five different approaches that solve these problems."**

---

## Solution 1: HttpClient with CompletableFuture (3:30–5:00)

[SCREEN: Open VeoJava project in IDE]

**"Let's start with pure Java—no Spring dependencies. This approach uses the built-in HttpClient with CompletableFuture for async handling."**

[Show HttpClientVeoVideoClient.java]

```java
public CompletableFuture<VideoResult> generateVideoAsync(VideoGenerationRequest request) {
    return CompletableFuture
        .supplyAsync(() -> submitVideoGeneration(request))
        .thenCompose(response -> pollForCompletion(response.operationId()))
        .thenApply(this::downloadVideo);
}

private CompletableFuture<String> pollForCompletion(String operationId) {
    return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
        OperationStatus status;
        do {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(5000);
                status = checkOperationStatus(operationId);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
        } while (!status.done());
        return operationId;
    });
}
```

**"This approach moves the blocking to a separate thread pool, which is better, but still not ideal. We're still blocking threads unnecessarily. The key improvement here is the HttpClient configuration for handling redirects:"**

```java
private final HttpClient httpClient = HttpClient.newBuilder()
    .followRedirects(HttpClient.Redirect.NORMAL)
    .connectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
    .build();
```

**"The redirect handling is crucial because Google's file service returns a 302 redirect to the actual video content. Most developers miss this and wonder why their downloads fail."**

---

## Solution 2: Spring RestClient (5:00 - 6:00)

[SCREEN: Show RestClientVeoVideoClient.java]

**"If you're using Spring Boot, RestClient provides a cleaner API with excellent redirect handling out of the box:"**

```java
@Component
public class RestClientVeoVideoClient implements VeoVideoClient {
    
    private final RestClient restClient;
    
    public RestClientVeoVideoClient() {
        this.restClient = RestClient.builder()
            .baseUrl("https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta")
            .defaultHeader("x-goog-api-key", apiKey)
            .requestFactory(clientHttpRequestFactory())
            .build();
    }
    
    @Override
    public VideoResult downloadVideo(String operationId) {
        // RestClient handles redirects automatically
        byte[] videoBytes = restClient.get()
            .uri("/operations/" + operationId)
            .retrieve()
            .body(byte[].class);
            
        return new VideoResult(/* ... */);
    }
}
```

**"RestClient is Spring's modern replacement for RestTemplate, and it handles the redirect issue elegantly with proper request factory configuration. But we still haven't solved the fundamental polling problem—we're still blocking threads unnecessarily."**

---

## Solution 3: ScheduledExecutorService Strategies (6:00 - 7:30)

[SCREEN: Show SelfSchedulingPollingStrategy.java]

**"This is where we get into the proper enterprise solutions. Instead of blocking threads, we use ScheduledExecutorService to handle the polling asynchronously. I've implemented two variants:"**

**"First, the self-scheduling approach:"**

```java
private CompletableFuture<String> pollForCompletion(VeoVideoClient client, String operationId) {
    CompletableFuture<String> future = new CompletableFuture<>();
    
    Runnable pollTask = new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                OperationStatus status = client.checkOperationStatus(operationId);
                
                if (status.done()) {
                    future.complete(operationId);
                } else {
                    scheduler.schedule(this, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {
                future.completeExceptionally(e);
            }
        }
    };
    
    scheduler.schedule(pollTask, 0, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    return future.orTimeout(10, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
}
```

**"This approach reschedules itself after each check, which gives you dynamic timing control. You could implement exponential backoff or adjust the interval based on load."**

[SCREEN: Show FixedRatePollingStrategy.java]

**"The fixed-rate approach is simpler and more predictable:"**

```java
private CompletableFuture<String> pollForCompletion(VeoVideoClient client, String operationId) {
    CompletableFuture<String> future = new CompletableFuture<>();
    
    ScheduledFuture<?> scheduledTask = scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(() -> {
        try {
            OperationStatus status = client.checkOperationStatus(operationId);
            if (status.done()) {
                future.complete(operationId);
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            future.completeExceptionally(e);
        }
    }, 0, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    
    future.whenComplete((result, throwable) -> scheduledTask.cancel(false));
    return future.orTimeout(10, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
}
```

**"Both approaches are non-blocking and resource-efficient. You can handle hundreds of concurrent video generation requests without exhausting your thread pool."**

---

## Solution 4: Reactive with Spring WebFlux (7:30 - 9:00)

[SCREEN: Show ReactiveVeoVideoClient.java]

**"Now for the most common asynchronous approach—reactive streams using Spring WebFlux. This gives you the most elegant solution with built-in backpressure handling:"**

```java
public Mono<VideoResult> generateVideoReactive(VideoGenerationRequest request) {
    return submitVideoGeneration(request)
            .flatMap(response -> pollUntilComplete(response.operationId()))
            .flatMap(this::downloadVideo);
}

private Mono<String> pollUntilComplete(String operationId) {
    return Flux.interval(Duration.ZERO, Duration.ofSeconds(5))
            .flatMap(_ -> checkOperationStatus(operationId))
            .filter(OperationStatus::done)
            .next()
            .handle((status, sink) -> {
                if (status.error() != null) {
                    sink.error(new RuntimeException("Video generation failed"));
                } else {
                    sink.next(operationId);
                }
            })
            .timeout(Duration.ofMinutes(10));
}
```

**"This approach is beautiful because it expresses the polling logic declaratively. Flux.interval creates a time-based stream, we map each tick to a status check, filter for completion, and take the first result. The entire chain is non-blocking and composable."**

[SCREEN: Show WebClient configuration]

```java
public ReactiveVeoVideoClient(@Value("${gemini.api.key}") String apiKey) {
    HttpClient httpClient = HttpClient.create().followRedirect(true);
    ReactorClientHttpConnector connector = new ReactorClientHttpConnector(httpClient);
    
    this.webClient = WebClient.builder()
            .baseUrl(BASE_URL)
            .clientConnector(connector)
            .codecs(configurer -> configurer.defaultCodecs().maxInMemorySize(2 * 1024 * 1024))
            .defaultHeader("x-goog-api-key", apiKey)
            .build();
}
```

**"Notice the 2MB buffer configuration—the default WebClient buffer is only 256KB, but Veo videos are around 635KB, so you need to increase this or your downloads will fail."**

---

## Solution 5: Virtual Threads (9:00–10:00)

[SCREEN: Show VirtualThreadPollingStrategy.java]

**"Finally, let's look at the Java 21+ solution - virtual threads. This gives you the simplicity of blocking code with the performance of async processing:"**

```java
@Override
public CompletableFuture<VideoResult> generateVideo(VeoVideoClient client, VideoGenerationRequest request) {
    return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
        try {
            VideoGenerationResponse response = client.submitVideoGeneration(request);
            String operationId = response.operationId();
            
            OperationStatus status;
            do {
                Thread.sleep(Duration.ofSeconds(5));
                status = client.checkOperationStatus(operationId);
            } while (!status.done());
            
            return client.downloadVideo(operationId);
            
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            throw new RuntimeException("Interrupted", e);
        }
    }, virtualExecutor);
}

private static final ExecutorService virtualExecutor = 
    Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
```

**"This looks like the naive approach, but it's running on virtual threads. Virtual threads are so lightweight that you can have millions of them, so blocking is no longer a concern. This is arguably the clearest and most maintainable solution if you're on Java 21 or later."**

## Performance Comparison & Recommendations (10:00 - 11:30)

[SCREEN: Comparison table]

| Approach          | Java Version | Complexity | Resource Usage         | Debugging | Best For         |
|-------------------|--------------|------------|------------------------|-----------|------------------|
| HttpClient        | 11+          | Medium     | High (thread blocking) | Easy      | Simple cases     |
| RestClient        | Spring 6+    | Low        | High (thread blocking) | Easy      | Spring apps      |
| ScheduledExecutor | 8+           | High       | Low                    | Medium    | Enterprise apps  |
| Reactive          | Spring 5+    | High       | Very Low               | Hard      | High-concurrency |
| Virtual Threads   | 21+          | Low        | Very Low               | Easy      | Modern Java apps |

**"Here are my recommendations:**

**"For new projects on Java 21+, use virtual threads. The code is simple, performant, and easy to debug."**

**"For high-concurrency applications, especially if you're already using Spring WebFlux, go reactive. The learning curve is steep, but the performance and composability are unmatched."**

**"For traditional Spring Boot applications, use the ScheduledExecutorService approaches. They give you the best balance of performance and maintainability on older Java versions."**

**"Avoid the naive blocking approaches in production—they'll cause problems under load."**

[SCREEN: Show demo running with performance metrics]

**"I've tested all these approaches with multiple concurrent requests, and the virtual thread and reactive solutions consistently handle 100+ concurrent video generations without breaking a sweat, while the blocking approaches start failing around 20–30 concurrent requests."**

---

## Gotchas and Production Tips (11:30–12:00)

[SCREEN: Code showing error handling]

**"Before we wrap up, here are the key gotchas that will save you hours of debugging:"**

**"First, always handle 302 redirects in your HTTP client configuration. Google's file service requires this."**

**"Second, increase buffer sizes for WebClient—videos are larger than default limits."**

**"Third, implement proper timeouts. Video generation can take up to 5 minutes, so set your timeouts accordingly."**

**"Fourth, remember the cost—each video costs about 6 dollars. Implement rate limiting and user quotas."**

**"Finally, the API has content filters. Generic prompts work better than specific celebrity or brand references."**
