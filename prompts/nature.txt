A serene mountain lake at dawn, with mist rising from the water's surface.
Pine trees line the shores, their reflections perfectly mirrored in the still water.
In the distance, snow-capped peaks glow with the first light of sunrise.
A family of deer emerges from the forest to drink at the water's edge.
Birds begin their morning songs as the sky transforms from deep blue to soft pink and gold.
