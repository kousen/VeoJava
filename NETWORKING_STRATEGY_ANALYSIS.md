# Networking Strategy Analysis: HTTP Clients and Polling Patterns

## Overview

This document summarizes the findings from implementing multiple HTTP client and polling strategies for the Google Veo 3 video generation API. We tested various combinations to determine the optimal approach for different scenarios.

## HTTP Client Strategy Analysis

### RestClient (Spring) - RECOMMENDED for Spring Apps

**Pros:**
- Native Spring integration with configuration properties
- Familiar Spring patterns and error handling
- Automatic Jackson serialization/deserialization
- Easy testing with Spring's test framework
- Built-in metrics and observability

**Cons:**
- Requires Spring Boot dependency
- Slightly more overhead than raw HttpClient

### HttpClient (Java 11+) - RECOMMENDED for Standalone/Library Code

**Pros:**
- Zero external dependencies
- Excellent performance
- Modern async API
- Works in any Java environment
- Smaller memory footprint

**Cons:**
- Manual JSON handling (requires Jackson or similar)
- More boilerplate code
- No Spring integration

### WebClient (Reactive) - SPECIALIZED USE CASE

**Pros:**
- Excellent for reactive applications
- Natural backpressure handling
- Great for high-concurrency scenarios
- Composable with other reactive streams

**Cons:**
- Reactive learning curve
- Overkill for simple use cases
- More complex error handling
- Requires Reactor knowledge

## Polling Strategy Analysis

### Virtual Threads (Java 21+) - RECOMMENDED

**Pros:**
- Simplest code (blocking style)
- Extremely lightweight (millions of threads possible)
- No thread pool management
- Perfect for I/O-bound operations like API polling
- Easy to understand and debug

**Cons:**
- Requires Java 21+
- Still experimental (preview in 19-20)

**Example:**
```java
// Simple blocking polling with virtual threads
do {
    Thread.sleep(Duration.ofSeconds(5));
    status = client.checkOperationStatus(operationId);
} while (!status.done());
```

### SelfScheduling - GOOD FALLBACK

**Pros:**
- Available since Java 8
- Familiar async patterns
- Good composition capabilities
- Works with existing thread pools

**Cons:**
- More complex than virtual threads
- Can create callback hell
- Thread pool exhaustion possible

### FixedRate - TRADITIONAL CHOICE

**Pros:**
- Battle-tested approach
- Predictable resource usage
- Fine-grained control over timing
- Works on older Java versions

**Cons:**
- More verbose code
- Manual thread management
- Fixed thread pool size

### Reactive (Flux) - SPECIALIZED

**Pros:**
- Excellent backpressure handling
- Composable with other reactive operations
- Good for complex stream processing

**Cons:**
- Steepest learning curve
- Overkill for simple polling
- Debugging complexity

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Spring Boot Applications (Java 21+)
```java
// BEST: RestClient + Virtual Thread polling
RestClientVeoVideoClient + VirtualThreadPollingStrategy
```
- **Why**: Combines Spring's ecosystem benefits with the simplicity of virtual threads
- **Use when**: Building Spring Boot microservices or web applications

### For Spring Boot Applications (Java 11-20)
```java
// GOOD: RestClient + SelfScheduling
RestClientVeoVideoClient + SelfSchedulingPollingStrategy
```
- **Why**: Spring integration with proven async patterns
- **Use when**: Stuck on older Java versions

### For Library/Standalone Code (Java 21+)
```java
// BEST: HttpClient + Virtual Threads
HttpClientVeoVideoClient + VirtualThreadPollingStrategy
```
- **Why**: Zero dependencies, maximum performance, simple code
- **Use when**: Building libraries, command-line tools, or non-Spring applications

### For High-Concurrency Reactive Systems
```java
// SPECIALIZED: WebClient + Reactive polling
ReactiveVeoVideoClient + ReactivePollingStrategy
```
- **Why**: Natural fit for reactive architectures with backpressure
- **Use when**: Already using reactive patterns throughout your application

## Key Insights from This Study

### 1. Virtual Threads are a Game Changer
Virtual threads make blocking I/O simple again without the performance penalty. For API polling scenarios like video generation, they're ideal because:
- You can write simple, readable blocking code
- No need for complex async patterns
- Excellent resource utilization
- Easy error handling and debugging

### 2. RestClient Hits the Sweet Spot
For Spring applications, RestClient provides the best balance of:
- Framework integration
- Simplicity
- Performance
- Maintainability

### 3. Reactive is Powerful but Specialized
Reactive patterns (WebClient + Flux) should only be used when:
- You're already committed to reactive programming
- You need sophisticated backpressure handling
- You're dealing with high-concurrency streaming scenarios

For simple request-response API calls, reactive adds unnecessary complexity.

### 4. HttpClient is the Universal Choice
Java's built-in HttpClient is excellent when you need:
- Zero dependencies
- Maximum performance
- Portability across environments
- Simple integration

## Performance Characteristics

Based on our testing with Veo 3 API (1-2 minute video generation):

| Strategy | Memory Usage | CPU Usage | Code Complexity | Debugging Ease |
|----------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Virtual Threads | Low | Low | Very Low | Excellent |
| SelfScheduling | Medium | Medium | Medium | Good |
| FixedRate | Medium | Low | Medium | Good |
| Reactive | Medium | Medium | High | Difficult |

## Production Recommendation

**If you must choose ONE approach for production:**

```java
// Java 21+ Spring Boot applications
RestClient + VirtualThreadPollingStrategy

// Java 21+ standalone/library code
HttpClient + VirtualThreadPollingStrategy

// Java 11-20 (any environment)
HttpClient + SelfSchedulingPollingStrategy
```

## Conclusion

This study demonstrates that **virtual threads + blocking code is often simpler and more performant** than complex async patterns for I/O-bound operations like API polling. The reactive approach, while powerful, adds complexity that's rarely justified unless you're building a fully reactive system.

**Key Principle**: Use the simplest solution that meets your constraints. Virtual threads make "simple blocking HTTP client" a viable choice again, even for high-concurrency scenarios.

## Migration Path

If you're currently using older async patterns:

1. **Java 8-17 → Java 21**: Migrate from SelfScheduling/FixedRate to Virtual Threads
2. **Servlet → Reactive**: Only if you have specific reactive requirements
3. **Legacy HTTP → Modern**: Prefer RestClient (Spring) or HttpClient (standalone) over legacy approaches

The investment in virtual threads will pay dividends in code simplicity and maintainability.
